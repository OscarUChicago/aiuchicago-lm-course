This repository contains all of the material I prepared for **AI@UChicago's** Language Models (LM) Course. **AI@UChicago** is the University of Chicago's student-run organization dedicated to fostering understanding, exploration, and innovation in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

Notable highlights in this notebook include:
* Complete Encoder-Decoder Transformer built from scratch utilizing the PyTorc Python framework, alongside applications of the model to a variety of toy examples.
* Rigorous introduction to various LM-related :hugs: Libraries (:hugs: Datasets, :hugs: Tokenizer, :hugs: Transformers).
